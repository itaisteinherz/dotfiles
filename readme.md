# dotfiles

These are mainly related to my (fairly basic) Windows/Ubuntu (in WSL) setup, which includes:

- zsh, with the [pure prompt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)
- [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and Node.js
- Homebrew
- NeoVim with plugins (based on `vim-plug`)
- Python
- Go
- PyCharm (with IdeaVim)
- Utilities such as Git, fzf and zoxide


## Getting Started

[Install `chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/), then run:

```bash
$ chezmoi init --apply itaisteinherz
```

To update to the latest dotfiles, run:

```bash
$ chezmoi update
```
